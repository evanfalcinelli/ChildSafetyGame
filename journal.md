## Meeting Notes

### Recitation Meeting 2/18

**Recap:**

- Professor Pozefsky agrees that we should add different levels based on the different rooms in the house
- For player feedback, we shouldn't wait until the end of the game since the players might already forget about their experience
 - We can asked the players questions after they complete each minigame/question, but we need to make sure that their gaming experience isn't disturbed
- We will use Carolina Cloud Apps to host the game; make sure that client sets up the account (easier down the line)
- When coding, try to work on the main game page + mini games at the same time
- As we use phaser more, we might not utilize React as much

**Action items:**

- Have official sprint goals planned out at the beginning of each sprint week
- Have phaser installed and every start working on it by next week

### Team Meeting 2/11
