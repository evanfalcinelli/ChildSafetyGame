## Meeting Notes

### Team Meeting 2/25

- Evan finished creating assets in Tiled
- Evan is continuing to work on the map using Tiled
- The art design of the game won't be as realistic as real life
- Daniel and John will work on creating the different pages and popups using Phaser
 - They will also try to work on transitioning from different pages/screen through Phaser
- Muyan will add the Tiled map in the game using Phaser 
 - Will also try to make the images stop at possible hazards if there is time left in the sprint

### Client Meeting 2/25

- Lindsay prefers "child" as the proper working 
- Helped Lindsay set up her Cloud CloudApps accounts
- Lindsay wants the game URL to be pediatricfallprevent.unc.edu
- Will send Lindsay more instructions regarding Carolina CloudApps over the weekend

### Recitation Meeting 2/23

- Clarify hazard description/rules in the design; change it so that no children can complete the level without facing any hazards
- Standardize wording throughout the design document; ask Lindsay if she prefers "child," "baby," or "toddler"
- More feedback on the design document in Sakai
- For next next, try to implement the Tiled map in using Phaser + also try to spawn multiple images

### Recitation Meeting 2/18

**Recap:**

- Professor Pozefsky agrees that we should add different levels based on the different rooms in the house
- For player feedback, we shouldn't wait until the end of the game since the players might already forget about their experience
 - We can asked the players questions after they complete each minigame/question, but we need to make sure that their gaming experience isn't disturbed
- We will use Carolina Cloud Apps to host the game; make sure that client sets up the account (easier down the line)
- When coding, try to work on the main game page + mini games at the same time
- As we use phaser more, we might not utilize React as much

**Action items:**

- Have official sprint goals planned out at the beginning of each sprint week
- Have phaser installed and every start working on it by next week

### Team Meeting 2/11
