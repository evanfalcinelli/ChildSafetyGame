## Rules

-	Should a team member miss a meeting, he should notify other team members ASAP; best if other members are notified 24 hours in advance
-	Main source of communication among team members will be Slack 
-	Try to check Slack at least twice a day (weekends included)
-	If there is a no response from a team member; other members will decide on the best action, and they might move on 
-   If a member has a busy week, he should notify the team during the team meeting so that everyone is update and assignment load can be adjusted (if needed)
-   Always utilize the Slack to ask for help and give assignment updates so everyone is on the page

## Coding Style

- TBD

## Git Collaboration

- In general, we will follow the [OneFlow](https://www.endoflineblog.com/oneflow-a-git-branching-model-and-workflow) model and workflow with only `master` branch in remote repository
- Changes do NOT have to always to proved by another member
- Members can push their code change when they feel is ready; we can always revert changes if necessary
