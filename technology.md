## Technology Overview

### React

In order to create an interactive browser game on mobile devices, we chose to use the [React](https://reactjs.org/) library.

JavaScript will be our language.

### Pixi (specifically w/ React)

We will use [Pixi](https://www.pixijs.com/) to customize the game and to make the game look fluid.

### Phaser.io

We will use [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) as our game framework to bring in different elements.

### Tiled

We will use [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) to generate different maps and levels.
