## Technology Overview

### React

In order to create an interactive browser game on mobile devices, we chose to use the [React](https://reactjs.org/) library.

JavaScript will be our language.

### Phaser.io

We will use [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) as our game framework to bring in different elements.

### Firebase

We will use [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to deploy our app when it's ready for production.
